# Deduplicate-Files
Delete duplicate files and/or unify them with hard links

There are two versions of this program. "dedup.sh" is a version intended to be run from the command line. "Duplicate Files.workflow" is an Automator action intended for use on computers running Apple's macOS. It's inside the .zip file.

I advise users to make backups before using this program.
