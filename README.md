# Deduplicate-Files
Delete duplicate files and/or unify them with hard links

Summary:

There are two versions of this program. "dedup.sh" is a version intended to be run from the command line. "Duplicate Files.workflow" is an Automator action intended for use on computers running Apple's macOS. It has fewer features, than the shell script version, but it may be more convenient for some macOS users. You'll find the workflow inside the .zip file.

Basic Instructions:

1.) I advise users to make backups before using this program.

2.) The program takes a single folder as an input. (Automator will permit you to try to run the program on multiple files at once. I may introduce that feature in a later version, but for now, the app will gracefully exit.)

3.) Shell script users can learn about all of the features with dedup.sh --help
